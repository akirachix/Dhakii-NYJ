        Martha comes from a community where a quarter of the population suffers
        from cancer and struggles to access proper care. Shockingly, most of 
        the hospitals in the area lack the crucial diagnostic tools needed to
        tackle this disease effectively. After the loss of her grandmother due
        to a misdiagnosed illness, Martha witnessed firsthand the harsh realities
        of rural healthcare. This experience ignited a fierce determination within 
        her to pursue software engineering, with a firm belief in the power of technology 
        to address these pressing issues. She intends to leverage her software development 
        skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence to develop user-friendly and 
        easily accessible diagnostic tools, such as rapid scanners and diagnostic devices, 
        to mitigate inadequate medical services.
